# Builder feedback: six weeks of XRPL integration

A living record for the SFF judges. **31 items: 16 implementation findings below,
plus the 15 September research submissions in the appendix.** This is a source
and history audit recorded on **2 Nov 2026**, not a fresh live-network test.
The dates in the log are audit dates; the commit column dates the original work.
The eight writers and their content are synthetic. Offline settlement is
**SIMULATED**; historical live receipts are **XRPL TESTNET · no real value**.
Neither is evidence of mainnet readiness.

## Top five: what we would fix first

1. **Ship a TypeScript payment recovery example, not just a successful payment.**
   Restart between signing and delivery and a naive retry can sign twice. Our
   `server/xrpl.ts` persists the blob before sending; `server/purchases.ts`
   reconciles the same hash. Repro: `npx vitest run tests/xrpl.test.ts` includes
   “after a restart, settles a stored payment that validated without signing
   again”. Original integration: `36ae0b7` (5 Oct). Suggested upstream example:
   durable intent → signed blob → validated ledger → delivery, with a crash at
   every boundary. A submit response is not finality.

2. **Give timeout a third state: pending.** A missing transaction on one node
   is not proof that money never moved. `XrplPayer.status` in `server/xrpl.ts`
   keeps the reservation when account sequence has advanced; expiry requires
   a validated ledger past LastLedgerSequence and an unused sequence. Repro:
   the “keeps the reservation when the payer Sequence moved” case in
   `tests/xrpl.test.ts`. Suggested fix: document this proof of absence and
   expose pending separately from failed in facilitator SDKs. Mainnet cannot
   safely treat an RPC timeout as permission to pay again.

3. **Publish one exact invoice-binding fixture across x402 and XRPL.** The
   HTTP `extra.invoiceId` is canonical JSON; XRPL `InvoiceID` is its SHA-256,
   uppercase hex. Mixing these representations breaks binding to the article,
   version, price and payee. Repro: `npx vitest run tests/x402.test.ts` checks
   key-order stability and every bound field; `tests/xrpl.test.ts` rejects
   settling a different quote. Workaround: `shared/x402.ts`, shipped in
   `433b971` (7 Oct). Suggested fix: cross-language vectors with the raw JSON,
   base64 header and ledger hash together, including malformed examples.

4. **Make the refund trust boundary explicit.** A ledger payment proves value
   transfer, not that an article kept its promise. `publisher/challenge.ts`
   refunds from the writer wallet; `server/challenges.ts` penalizes trust even
   if the writer refuses. Repro: `npx vitest run tests/challenge.test.ts
   tests/alphaleak.test.ts tests/xrpl.test.ts`. These are synthetic adversarial
   cases, not claims about real publishers. `docs/FINAL-PUSH.md` D5 explicitly
   records the limitation. Suggested fix: describe cooperative refunds and
   arbitration separately. Escrow (#261) remains a planned investigation.

5. **Treat pricing units as a deployment blocker.** S$ minor units map to XRP
   drops at a fixed demonstration rate, not a market quote. See
   `shared/contracts/` and `server/purchases.ts`; repro: compare the invoice
   drops against `DROPS_PER_MINOR` in `shared/`. #163 deliberately defers rate
   sourcing, rounding and refund drift. Suggested fix: a fully tested RLUSD
   path with issuer validation and trustline onboarding, or an expiring XRP
   rate quote. Mainnet pricing is a gap; this PR does not implement #163.

## Living implementation log

Severity describes the consequence without the workaround: **critical** can
risk money or unauthorized access; **high** blocks correctness or operation;
**medium** complicates integration. A code-derived failure mode is not a claim
that a production incident happened. Repro commands above use local fixtures;
no faucet, live models or Testnet funds are required.

| ID · recorded | Area | What happened / evidence | Our workaround (path) | Suggested upstream fix | Severity | Mainnet impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B16 · 2026-11-03 | XRPL tooling | Observed: #277 Testnet demo settled successfully but the Node process retained sockets after cleanup. Code-derived cause: parallel account/fee/ledger requests could create three clients before any connected, retaining only the last. Evidence: `docs/evidence/publish-site-277.md`, `tests/xrpl-connection.test.ts`. | `shared/xrpl.ts`: share one in-flight connection promise; close waits for it. No second payment was made. | Document sharing a connecting client in concurrent RPC examples; this is our wrapper bug, not an XRPL ledger defect. | medium | Resource lifetime issue on any rail; no payment correctness change. |
| B17 · 2026-11-03 | tooling | Observed restart recovery: #286 WIP `99f8545` remained attached to an abandoned clean worktree, so the requested branch checkout failed as already in use. | Verified the old checkout was clean, detached it at the WIP, then rebased the recovered branch in the active worktree. | Agent restart handoff should retain checkout ownership and give an explicit recovery action. | medium | No ledger incident or Testnet call; production recovery must preserve the durable payment DB, not just Git state. |
| B18 · 2026-11-03 | tooling | Observed #286 CI run `41561017423`: testing Vite's denylist against an absent `.env` returned the SPA fallback (200), while the local operator file returned 403. | `tests/client-admission.test.ts` now creates its own synthetic credential file and asserts 403 plus no canary bytes. | Security test examples should create their fixtures and test response bytes, rather than depend on developer secrets being present. | medium | Test portability failure; no credential disclosure observed, and no mainnet calls. |
| B01 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | A single account must not sign concurrent payments with the same Sequence; integration `36ae0b7`. | `server/xrpl.ts`: hold the payer queue through the facilitator response. | Provide a per-account sequence queue example, including multiple processes. | critical | In-process locking is done; distributed signer coordination is a gap. |
| B02 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | A restart after signing loses payment identity unless persisted first; `tests/xrpl.test.ts` restart case. | `server/xrpl.ts`, `server/store.ts`: persist signed blob before send. | Include a durable outbox in the quickstart. | critical | Done locally; backup/recovery and durable production storage remain gaps. |
| B03 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | A missing tx lookup can coexist with an advanced payer sequence; `tests/xrpl.test.ts` reservation case. | `server/xrpl.ts`: validated ledger + LastLedgerSequence + account Sequence proof, otherwise pending. | Specify pending and provable expiry in SDK return types. | critical | Done locally; reconciliation service and alarms are gaps. |
| B04 · 2026-11-02 | x402 | HTTP invoice JSON and ledger InvoiceID have different representations; `433b971`. | `shared/x402.ts`: canonical JSON → SHA-256 uppercase hex. | Publish cross-language binding vectors. | critical | Binding done; ecosystem interoperability still needs external validation. |
| B05 · 2026-11-02 | x402 | Invalid base64, schema and oversized headers need explicit rejection; `tests/x402.test.ts`. | `shared/x402.ts`: schema validation and 8 KiB encoded-header cap. | State header limits and test negative cases at proxy boundaries. | high | Local parsing done; deployed proxy limits untested. |
| B06 · 2026-11-02 | x402 | Duplicate retries must return the same delivery; `tests/facilitator.test.ts` duplicate and parallel cases. | `publisher/facilitator.ts`, `publisher/journal.ts`: inflight deduplication and settlement by hash. | Include concurrent retry and restart conformance tests. | critical | Done locally; multi-instance facilitator correctness needs validation. |
| B07 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | Preliminary submit success is not validated delivered value; `tests/xrpl.test.ts` wrong ledger amount case. | `shared/xrpl.ts`, `publisher/facilitator.ts`: validated tesSUCCESS and exact payment checks. | Show delivered-amount verification beside submit. | critical | Done for XRP/Testnet; issued-currency checks remain a gap. |
| B08 · 2026-11-02 | Testnet | Reset recovery must retain wallet identities; wallet helper explicitly supports resets. | `scripts/wallets.mjs`: fund existing addresses; write new seeds before faucet calls. | Document idempotent reset recovery and faucet failure handling. | high | Testnet tool only; mainnet funding must never use a faucet. |
| B09 · 2026-11-02 | tooling | ECDSA runtime import prevented Node 22 publisher startup; `8c7e24a` (7 Oct). | `publisher/registry.ts`: type-only ECDSA import. | Test the TypeScript starter against the declared Node runtime. | high | Pin and verify runtime/package compatibility before deployment. |
| B10 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | Refunds are cooperative; the writer can refuse or time out (FINAL-PUSH D5). | `publisher/challenge.ts`, `server/challenges.ts`: write-once refund and trust penalty independent of repayment. | Document the limitation; offer a separately evaluated dispute design. | high | Enforceable dispute settlement is a gap; #261 is not shipped. |
| B11 · 2026-11-02 | XRPL | S$ display and XRP settlement use a fixed demo conversion; #163 stays open. | `server/purchases.ts`, `shared/contracts/`: integer drops and quote matching. | Add issuer-aware RLUSD or expiring rate quotes with rounding/refund rules. | high | Mainnet price formation is a gap. |
| B12 · 2026-11-02 | Starter Kit | Our Node flow implements the XRPL x402 handshake itself; generic/older header examples cannot be mixed (integration contract). | `docs/x402-xrpl.md`, `shared/contracts/x402.ts`: freeze v2 PAYMENT-* headers and xrpl:1. | Supply one tested XRPL-first TypeScript quickstart and compatibility matrix. | medium | Our implementation is not upstream Starter Kit conformance certification. |
| B13 · 2026-11-02 | Testnet | Offline signed blobs must not masquerade as Testnet; `tests/xrpl.test.ts` rail refusal cases. | `server/xrpl.ts`, `publisher/facilitator.ts`: reject SIMULATED payer on Testnet and label receipts. | Ship an explicitly labelled simulator with rail mismatch tests. | critical | Simulation boundary done; mainnet remains disabled. |
| B14 · 2026-11-02 | tooling | Historical decision run bought too little: F1 0.24, S$1.60 wasted of S$4.05; `eval/REPORT-decisions.md` (9 Oct, `4e3a2a5`). | `server/agents/loop.ts`: requested-fact rounds; report preserves keyword search, fixture writer and simulated payment substitutions. | Pair agent-payment starters with value-of-information evals, not payment counts alone. | medium | Payment correctness does not demonstrate economic utility. |
| B15 · 2026-11-02 | tooling | Writer self-grading called 22/76 supported snapshots partial; `eval/REPORT-coverage.md` (9 Oct). | `server/agents/requirements.ts`: explicit coverage rubric; separate decision-model grading adopted in `a8b60cc`. | Include evidence-coverage and false-complete checks in agent examples. | medium | Historical model evidence only; ongoing quality measurement is still needed. |

## Mainnet readiness checklist

**Decision: GAP — Testnet demonstration only.** “Done” means implemented and
covered locally, never a mainnet approval. No live verification was performed
for this audit. Compliance items below are questions for qualified review, not
claims that a law applies or that a credential satisfies it.

| Status | Control | Evidence or next required work |
|---|---|---|
| done (local) | Budget-only authority, policy-only purchases, no premium bytes before grant | `server/purchases.ts`, `tests/purchase.test.ts`; preserve all five gates. |
| done (local) | One intent / one charge, persist-before-submit, reconciliation | `server/store.ts`, `server/xrpl.ts`, `tests/xrpl.test.ts`. |
| done (local) | Exact XRP amount, invoice binding and Testnet restriction | `shared/x402.ts`, `shared/xrpl.ts`, `publisher/facilitator.ts`. |
| gap | Key custody and signer policy | Replace development environment seeds with KMS/HSM or external signer; rotate keys, audit access and implement recovery. |
| gap | Price units: RLUSD vs XRP drops (#163) | Select denomination, validate issuer/trustlines, define rounding, quote expiry and refund drift. Do not treat the fixed demo rate as FX. |
| gap | Facilitator SLA and distributed operation | Define availability, latency, idempotency across instances, durable storage, incident ownership and fallback reconciliation. |
| gap | Reserves, fees and funding | Model account/owner reserves, token trustline reserves, fee headroom and refund liquidity against the chosen network; alert before depletion. |
| gap | Monitoring and operations | Alert on pending age, failed delivery after settlement, duplicate intents, balance/fee changes and refund refusal. Test failover and backup restore. |
| gap | Writer identity and compliance | Review writer onboarding, KYC, sanctions and whether Travel Rule obligations apply. Assess XRPL Credentials as an identity attestation mechanism; credentials alone are not a compliance decision. |
| gap | Privacy and retention | Keep research questions, personal data and secrets off the ledger; define retention, receipt access and deletion policy. |
| gap | Disputes and refunds | Cooperative refunds are built, enforceable settlement is not. Evaluate #261; document refusal, escalation and loss allocation. |
| gap | Independent security / production validation | Multi-process concurrency, external x402 interop, abuse/load testing and explicit network enablement review before mainnet. |

### Submitted feedback

#### 1. Facilitator reliability and reconciliation

While preparing an XRPL agentic-payment flow, I found a reliability gap in the x402 quickstart: it requires T54's hosted testnet facilitator, which the XRPL documentation labels best-effort with no committed SLA, but the guide does not provide a local facilitator, deterministic simulator, or clear reconciliation guidance for facilitator outages versus invalid payments. A local test harness plus documented retry, idempotency, and receipt-reconciliation behavior would make hackathon and production integration much easier to debug.

#### 2. Bounded autonomous signing

The XRPL agent documentation has an autonomy ambiguity: the x402 guide describes payment as requiring no human in the loop, while the Agent Wallet skill requires explicit human confirmation for every signature by default. The docs mention auto-signing but do not show one concise, end-to-end example of bounded autonomy with network, destination, amount, and expiry constraints. A single approved-autonomy example, clearly separated from production policy-gated signing, would prevent builders from either blocking unattended x402 flows or weakening authorization controls.

#### 3. Wrong chain starter examples

The general x402-secure reference examples default to Base Sepolia and generic x402.org facilitator endpoints, while the XRPL path uses the separate x402-xrpl package, XRPL-specific network identifiers, and a different facilitator. For an XRPL hackathon, following the generic starter path can produce a syntactically valid but wrong-chain prototype before the mismatch is obvious. An XRPL-first quickstart, install command, and runtime validation that rejects unsupported network and asset combinations would prevent this expensive integration detour.

#### 4. Package version pinning

The XRPL x402 documentation warns that the x402-xrpl package is early-stage and recommends pinning a specific version, but its quickstart installs x402-xrpl without a version pin and provides no tested lockfile or compatibility matrix. That makes a hackathon demo vulnerable to silent SDK changes and makes bug reports hard to reproduce. Publishing the exact tested package version, a lockfile, and a small protocol-compatibility table would materially improve reliability for builders.

#### 5. Network and asset validation

The XRPL x402 payer quickstart sets network_filter=None, meaning the client accepts any network declared by the server, while the same wallet guidance emphasizes explicit network checks and safe authorization. Because a 402 response supplies the payment terms that the client signs, the example should default to an explicit testnet network and asset allowlist, with a clear warning before accepting mainnet or unexpected terms. A fail-closed network and destination validation example would prevent a misconfigured or malicious paywall from steering an agent into an unintended payment path.

#### 6. Python version prerequisites

The XRPL agent documentation has conflicting Python prerequisites: the general Getting Started tutorial says Python 3.9+, while the XRPL x402 guide requires Python 3.11+. A builder following the first page can pass the stated prerequisite and still fail when installing or running the x402 path. The docs should declare one supported matrix per workflow and publish a tested requirements or lock file so environment failures are distinguishable from XRPL integration failures.

#### 7. TypeScript quickstart coverage

The XRPL x402 landing page advertises a TypeScript client, but the XRPL-specific implementation guide explicitly says it currently includes Python examples only. This leaves Node.js builders to infer the XRPL header, signing, receipt, and retry flow from a different ecosystem example. A minimal tested TypeScript quickstart using the XRPL package, with the exact network and facilitator configuration, would make the advertised client support real rather than discoverable only through reverse engineering.

#### 8. RLUSD trustlines and issuer onboarding

The XRPL x402 guide says x402-xrpl supports RLUSD for stable pricing, but the runnable quickstart demonstrates XRP only and does not show the required trustline creation, issuer verification, reserve impact, or the failure mode when the recipient cannot hold the issued currency. XRPL trustline tokens cannot be delivered without an appropriate trust line. A complete RLUSD example should provision and validate the trustline before signing, and explain how to surface tecPATH_DRY or issuer mistakes.

#### 9. SourceTag default mismatch

Agent attribution is inconsistent across the XRPL agent materials: the Agent Wallet and Payments skills use SourceTag 20260530, while the XRPL x402 quickstart defaults to 20260601. A builder combining the wallet skill with the x402 middleware can produce valid payments that split across attribution queries, making agent volume and audit trails incomplete. The ecosystem should publish one canonical tag policy or clearly define separate tags and their intended ownership.

#### 10. Payment retry and duplicate settlement

The XRPL x402 quickstart describes payment, facilitator receipt retrieval, and the HTTP retry as one automatic flow, but it does not explain the crash window where the on-ledger Payment succeeds and the client times out before receiving the receipt or final resource. A naive retry could submit a second payment for the same request, while abandoning the request loses a successful settlement. The client and merchant examples should show an invoice or idempotency key, hash-based reconciliation, and a safe retry-after-settlement procedure.

#### 11. Network identifier compatibility

The XRPL x402 guide uses xrpl:1 for Testnet and xrpl:0 for Mainnet, while the OpenWallet Standard reference uses the canonical CAIP-2 identifiers xrpl:testnet and xrpl:mainnet. A builder combining x402 payments with a policy-gated wallet can pass a valid-looking identifier that another layer rejects or interprets differently. Publishing one canonical mapping and a conversion helper would remove a subtle cross-tool integration failure.

#### 12. DestinationTag and X address support

The XRPL x402 quickstart models payTo as a plain classic address, but many hosted accounts require a DestinationTag and XRPL payments can fail when the destination account enforces one. The quickstart should explain whether x402 payment requirements can carry a destination tag or X-address, how the client validates it, and how a merchant advertises the requirement. Without that path, an agent can pay the right institution but still receive a validated failure such as tecDST_TAG_NEEDED.

#### 13. SourceTag ownership and attribution

The XRPL x402 payer example says the on-chain SourceTag is the value declared by the merchant, while the Agent Wallet guidance presents SourceTag as a way to attribute agent-generated activity. Those ownership models conflict: an untrusted paywall can choose the tag that appears in the payer’s transaction and distort agent or merchant analytics. The protocol should define whether the payer, merchant, or facilitator owns each attribution field and provide a tamper-resistant convention for both sides.

#### 14. Testnet reset recovery

The XRPL faucet documentation warns that testnet balances and ledger history may be reset, while the agentic-payment quickstart presents a wallet, payment, and explorer flow without a reset-aware test fixture or verification strategy. After a reset, saved addresses, transaction hashes, and trustline state can silently become invalid and make a demo look nondeterministic. A documented disposable-wallet bootstrap, network-health check, and reset-safe integration test would make agent demos much easier to reproduce.

#### 15. Endpoint transport and network identity

The XRPL agent materials use a WebSocket endpoint on port 51233 for the wallet flow and an HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint on port 51234 for the x402 payer, but do not explain why the transports and ports differ or how to health-check that they refer to the same network. A builder can copy the wrong endpoint into an otherwise correct payment flow and get opaque connection or ledger-state errors. The quickstarts should show a network-identity check and a small endpoint matrix for WebSocket, JSON-RPC, Testnet, and Mainnet.
